Etch synergetic contract code includes specific function annotations. These need to be all present or absent, and only one of each type is allowed.

-   `@problem` specifies a problem.

-   `@objective` measures the solution to a given problem.

-   `@work` creates a solution from a random number/nonce.

-   `@clear` finishes the competition, zeros everything, and saves the solution.

You can find an example of a synergetic contract and these annotations [here](smart-contracts/executing-synergetic-code/).
